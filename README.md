I am a graduate student at Florida Institute of Technology who is pursuing a Master of Science in Computer Information Systems and passionate about intersecting data with human impact. I have a strong interest in data analytics, business intelligence, and machine learning for business solutions. I have hands-on experience with tools like Python, Java, SQL, Tableau, and Power BI, and I enjoy transforming complex data into meaningful insights that support strategic decisions. My background includes customer-facing roles and technical projects, such as developing dashboards and analyzing real-world datasets, which have helped me build both strong analytical and communication skills. I'm actively seeking opportunities where I can grow as a data analyst and contribute to data-driven teams! 😊
